# Git versus Github

Git is a versioning software, similar to SVN, Mercurial, and others. It can be used locally, storing changes in a .git directory. It can also be used to store repositories online, such as on Github or Bitbucket.

The `git` command is a quick way to see all available subcommands. The most important commands for us are:

* `git add`
* `git commit`
* `git push`
